# OpenCV Portfolio

Welcome to my OpenCV portfolio! This repository showcases various projects developed using OpenCV, primarily during my Erasmus mobility semester.

## About

OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision and image processing tasks. In this portfolio, I demonstrate my skills and creativity through projects that leverage OpenCV's capabilities.

## Main and Final Project of all

### Snapchat Mask Filter Prototype

- **File:** `misnap.py`
- **Description:** This Python script simulates a Snapchat mask filter using OpenCV. Explore the code to see how facial landmarks are detected and augmented with digital masks in real-time.

*Note: Additional projects may be added in the future as the portfolio expands.*

## Getting Started

To run the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the desired project file in your preferred Python environment.
4. Install the necessary dependencies, if any, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the script and explore the results!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
